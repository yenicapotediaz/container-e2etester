# e2etester docker image is for running the e2etest suite against Kubernetes

The e2e-test suite has many options depending on which tests to run and what the underlying hardware is.  This image will execute
e2e conformance tests on aws.  It may work for other test suites and on other platforms but they have not been tested.
